<h2>SQL Project 1</h2>

I would like to review the top 10 loans with the highest loan amount and should include the following: ID of the loan, amount of the loan, type of loan, and status of the loan.

<h2>SQL Project 2</h2>
Our Data Processing team needs a list of when all transactions batched, along with the month, day, year, and how long ago they batched. We usually batch our transactions 3 days after the transaction date. Be sure to include the transaction ID, date of the transaction, type of transaction, amount of the transaction, and balance after the transaction. The list should show the most recent batch year, then by batch month.
